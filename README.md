This project is a Discord chatbot that interacts with users by providing personalized responses, spam protection, and AI-generated replies. It uses custom rules for specific users and integrates a generative AI model for general queries. The bot listens for messages where it's mentioned, processes them, and responds accordingly. It also handles long messages by splitting them into smaller chunks. The bot is designed for scalability, allowing easy additions like new features or more complex interactions. It ensures smooth communication in Discord servers with message content and spam control.
